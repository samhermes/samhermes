            <h1>About</h1>
            <p class="intro">I am a web developer at Washington University in St. Louis.</p>
            <p>I use WordPress to create performant, maintainable, responsive websites.</p>
            <p>I have been making web things since I was in high school in 2007. I was a student computer tech, and as part of that, I updated the school's website. We had Dreamweaver and fast internet, and I spent a lot of time trying to get things just the way I wanted them.</p>
            <p>For Christmas 2008, my uncle designed and launched samuelhermes.com. I was still a little unfamiliar with how you got ahold of domain names, so it seemed absolutely crazy. That wore off a little after I found out that domain names weren't impossible to come by. Still, it was an awesome gift.</p>
            <p>The first project I did for a client for the Jacksonville Theatre Guild. The website is no longer on the web, but it taught me so much about the relationship between client, site, and me. No longer was I doing things on my own time.</p>
            <p>When I went to college, I chose Computer Management &amp; Information Systems as my major. I still liked working on websites, I just wasn't sure it could turn into The Thing. I took the few courses offered that had something to do with the web. In my free time, I was still working on client projects.</p>
            <p>I started using Treehouse my junior year. The videos, quizzes, and code exercises were great for laying a foundation. Learning by Googling usually skips over the basics and drops you right in the middle of something. Treehouse really helped me start from the beginning. Some things I learned over, but it gave everything more context and filled in the holes.</p>
