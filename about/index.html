        <p class="intro">I am a web developer at Washington University in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>I use WordPress to create performant, maintainable, responsive websites.</p>
        <p>I have been making web things since I was in high school in 2007. I was a student computer tech, and as part of that, I updated the school's website. We had Dreamweaver and fast internet, and I spent a lot of time trying to get things just the way I wanted them.</p>
        <p>For Christmas 2008, my uncle designed and launched samuelhermes.com. I was still a little unfamiliar with how you got ahold of domain names, so it seemed absolutely crazy. It gave me a place to experiment that was totally my own. I've lost count of how many different versions of my website I have created.</p>
        <p>The first project I did for a client was for the Jacksonville Theatre Guild. The website is no longer on the web, but it taught me so much about the relationship between client, site, and me.</p>
        <p>When I went to college, I chose Computer Management &amp; Information Systems as my major. I still liked working on websites, I just wasn't sure it could turn into The Thing. I took the few courses offered that had something to do with the web. In my free time, I was still working on client projects.</p>
        <p>I started using Treehouse my junior year. The videos, quizzes, and code exercises were great for laying a foundation. Learning by Googling usually skips over the basics and drops you right in the middle of something. Treehouse really helped me start from the beginning. Some things I learned over, but it gave everything more context and filled in the holes.</p>
        <p>I have thoroughly enjoyed being able to work on so many client projects, which are listed on my work page. Although I have transitioned to full time, I still continue working on projects in my spare time.</p>
