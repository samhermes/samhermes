            <h2><a href="/posts/add-one-hour-to-date-and-time-in-php">Add 1 hour to date &amp; time in PHP</a></h2>
            <p>This is probably the most magical thing I’ve ever done PHP. Pass in the date and time (in this case, in a variable), tell it what you want to do with it, and out comes the updated date and time. I needed to add an hour to the time I was working with. Seems simple until you think about transition to the next day. This function takes care of advancing the date to the next day if necessary.</p>

            <h2><a href="/posts/using-vertical-height-media-queries-with-fixed-headers">Using vertical height media queries with fixed headers</a></h2>
            <p>We all know lots of people who have been #blessed with large screens to work on, and so setting up a fixed header can make a lot of sense. Why not use that extra screen real estate? The philosophies of responsive design can and should apply to this as well. Screen height should be taken into account, and fixed headers should be disabled if there is not enough height for them to be useful (although, I would argue that they are never useful).</p>

            <h2><a href="/posts/designing-for-every-moment">Designing for every moment</a></h2>
            <p>Responsive design is truly about each and every point in between the smallest supported viewport and the largest, which leaves a lot of possibilities. If truly designing for a fully responsive experience, you should give attention to the awkward moments of change. One of those moments is when an element comes into contact with the edge of the screen.</p>

            <h2><a href="/posts/giving-back">Giving back</a></h2>
            <p>Everything I’ve learned about working on the web, I’ve learned on the web. From reading blogs to doing Treehouse courses to simply reading Twitter, it all took place on one website or another. Up to this point, I’ve really only been taking things in. I don’t think it’s a bad thing, I’ve simply been learning as much as I can. However, I think the time has come that I try to give back a little.</p>
