Trader Joe’s has been there this entire time. We just never properly met. Until recently. You hear enough chatter about a place, and you just have to go and investigate it for yourself. It’s true with anything, really. (I apologize for my writing style at the moment, I’m in the middle of House of Cards)

So, I recently went to take a closer look. And then I filled up a basket and before long was munching on cashew cookies on my couch. Crumbs everywhere. One of the other things I found was mango green tea, and it’s on its way to replace cranberry juice as my drink of choice. If you know how I feel about cranberry juice, you know this is real.

Trader Joe’s, I must mention, definitely got the memo that pumpkin is in season. Pumpkin soup, pumpkin pancakes, pumpkin everything. I, personally, went for the pumpkin soup. We’ll see, but I bet it’s delicious.

The first time I went to Trader Joe’s was on a weekend. Then I went the next weekend. Now, it’s just the start of another weekend. Will I find myself picking up another box of Joe O’s? Time will tell.
