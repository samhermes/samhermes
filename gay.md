title: I'm Gay.
---
I just came out again! Woo! I wish it was always this easy. Since you’re here, how about a little bit about how I got here?

I came out for the first time in college, and spent quite a while figuring out what that meant. I already had a lot of ideas of what I thought a gay person was like, what they did, how they behaved, what they dressed like, and all of that. I also had a lot of ideas about who I was already, and not that many of them seemed to match up with what I thought I’d need to be as a gay person. How silly that was.

The biggest thing I’ve learned is that you can sum up gay people in one way and one way only: they are attracted to the same sex. That’s it. There are certainly stereotypes and statistics, but gay people are as diverse as everyone else. When you come out, you do not have to change anything about yourself, you only need to embrace yourself for who you have been all along.

I have a website called [Gay Feelings](https://gayfeelings.com) where I write more about being gay. The goal is to capture the parts of the gay experience that aren’t usually talked about, and dig a little deeper. The site is open for submissions, so think about what you might want to share yourself.
