    A primary goal of this project was to demonstrate just how many places around the globe WashU is having an impact, which led to the interactive map on the homepage. The map is driven by the stories posted on the site, relying on a custom taxonomy. I led the front end portion of this project, creating the markup, styling, and interactivity/animation layer.

    ### Halle

    _2018 &ndash; Present_

    * **Technology:** WordPress, Gulp

    I designed and developed a custom WordPress theme, specifically for the official WordPress theme repository. I wanted to go through the theme review process, to learn more about what makes a good WordPress theme. On top of the standard review, Halle also went through an accessibility audit, and maintains the “Accessibility Ready” tag.
