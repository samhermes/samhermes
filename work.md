        <h3>Students site</h3>
        <p>I was the front end lead for this project, working on a flexible front end architecture to support the variety of components and templates needed for the site.</p>

        <h3>Diversity maps</h3>
        <p>I used Mapbox GL JS to display faculty origin and degree data on an interative map. This demonstrated the global reach of the university. The Diversity team is able to make updates at their convenience from the WordPress admin.</p>

        <h3>WashU Patterns</h3>
        <p>I created a pattern library to document the styles and components that my team was using most frequently. It also serves as a reference for coding and version control standards.</p>

        <h3>WashU Web Theme</h3>
        <p>I was a part of the web theme team, which manages a university-wide WordPress theme and suite of plugins. As part of the project, I was a member of a guidance group that was tasked with developing direction and maintenance the project.</p>

        <h3>Research search</h3>
        <p>I implemented the homepage search feature, the most frequently used feature of this site. Accessibility was a top priority in my work on this, to ensure that all users would receive the same experience while searching.</p>

        <h3>University Directory</h3>
        <p>I redesigned the university's directory search feature, returning results to the user almost immediately through Ajax. As one of the tools used daily by university staff, this UX improvement directly impacted productivity.</p>
