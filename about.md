I got my start on the web making updates to my small town high school's website. I used the design view of Dreamweaver, adding rows and columns to table-based layouts. Slowly but surely, I worked my way into the code. In college, I started watching videos on [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com), relearning some of the things I had taught myself. Treehouse helped me get started with WordPress, which enabled me to take projects much further than I had been able to. That, in turn, made my web skills into something I could share with businesses and organizations.

Now, I'm a web developer at Washington University in St. Louis in the Office of Public Affairs. I help create and manage WordPress themes and plugins for university websites. I primarily focus on the front end, working in Sass, JavaScript, SVG, and a little PHP.

Outside of work, I enjoy attending plays and musicals, biking, binging on Gilmore Girls, reading about humans, and listening to podcasts. Someday, I just might try something new.
