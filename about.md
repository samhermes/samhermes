  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>I am a web developer at Washington University in St. Louis in the Office of Public Affairs. I help create and manage WordPress themes and plugins for university websites. I primarily focus on the front end, working in CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.</p>

  <p>Outside of work, I enjoy biking, attending musicals, and listening to podcasts. I also enjoy binging on Netflix, eating donuts, and dancing in my apartment.</p>

  <p>I'm on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/samhermes">@samhermes</a>.</p>
