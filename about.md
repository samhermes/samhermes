<p class="subhead">I believe in the power of the web to educate, inform, and connect.</p>

We've gotten a little sidetracked, but the web can transform your life in ways previously impossible, and that must be protected. To this end, accessibility and performance are incredibly important to my work. Alongside this, I have a deep respect for [the web's grain](https://frankchimero.com/writing/the-webs-grain/), and it informs everything that I create.

I got started making websites in high school, where I made small updates to the school's website using the design tab of Dreamweaver. Over time, I moved into writing code. In college, I solidified my skills using [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com) and learned how to use WordPress to deliver client websites.

These days, whe web platform is a strange and interesting place. There's always more to learn, and sometimes a little to unlearn. During the day, I work at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu), where I develop WordPress themes and plugins for the university's many websites. At night, I read books, listen to podcasts, and try to remember what it's like to be human.
