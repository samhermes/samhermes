			Austin Wiley and Zach Parsons are a gay couple living in the Midwest. They
			met six months ago at their local outdoor theater, where Austin was on
			stage, and Zach was behind the scenes. When they found each other, they
			knew that they had something special. Now, they're living together and
			finding out what it means to be a gay couple in a place that doesn't
			always welcome them with open arms.
