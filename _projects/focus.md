        <h2>Designed for WordPress</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">Focus works seamlessly with the Image and Gallery block in WordPress.</p>
        <p>The problem: WordPress does not link to a full size version of an image when it's placed in a gallery block. Additionally, most themes do not include a photo gallery or lightbox. Focus handles all of this for you, so all you have to do is hit publish.</p>

        <h3>Theme Compatibility</h3>
        <p>In the wild world of WordPress, it can be difficult to ensure 100% compatibility with every theme and plugin. If you find that Focus just isn't jelling with your WordPress site, <a href="https://samhermes.typeform.com/to/d4C4FT">reach out</a>.</p>
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>Creating accessible sites is really important, and I've given special care to making Focus WCAG compliant. As we're talking about images here, the best thing you can do is add alt text to each image that you add to your WordPress site. Learn how best to do this here. If you find that Focus is causing an accessibility error on your site, please <a href="https://samhermes.typeform.com/to/d4C4FT">let me know</a>.</p>
