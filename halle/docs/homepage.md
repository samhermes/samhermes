title: Manually curating the homepage
---
The featured posts that display on the homepage will default to the most recently published posts on your site, but they can be manually curated instead.

1. Create a new category named “Featured”
2. When creating a new story, or editing a previously published story, add the “Featured” category. This can be done by checking the box next to “Featured” in the Categories box.

The order of the posts will appear in the order that they were published. This means that the most recently published story within the “Featured” category will show first.

To change the order of featured posts, you will need to update the publish date to a more recent day and time.

In any event, the posts will not display until there are at least four posts with featured images.
