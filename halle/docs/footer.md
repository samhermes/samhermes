title: Setting up the footer
---
The footer of Halle is controlled using widgets. This means that all of the footer content can be controlled within the admin. Widgets for the footer will be stored in the “Footer” widget area.

1. Select Appearance from the WordPress menu, then select Widgets.
2. To add a widget, drag a widget of your choosing into the “Footer” widget area. The widget options will open after you drop it.

The footer layout will automatically adjust based on how many widgets you add. The recommended maximum is 4 widgets, though more are supported if you need to display additional information.
