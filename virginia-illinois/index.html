            <p>â€‹The City of Virginia was looking to update their existing website to enable control over their content and bring the design of their site up to date. I created a custom WordPress theme and configured their installation to be easy to manage and update.</p>
            <p>The theme for the site was built using <a href="http://underscores.me/">Underscores</a>, which provided an excellent foundation. The main navigation on small screens is toggled by a simple script included with Underscores. The site was developed from the outset to be reponsive, and provides a solid structure for content development as time goes on.</p>
            <p>One of the most frequent updates to the site is the monthly board meeting minutes, which are under the City Government section of the site. It made sense to create a custom post type to handle them, which keeps them easy to access from the admin. The minutes are posted in plain text, allowing them to be easily read from any device, ensuring that the information is readily available.</p>
            <p>All of the floated sidebar elements are stored in a repeater field, making them easy to add and remove. There are two different options provided, one for a link and one for an image. This allows for the links to be updated as necessary, and makes all site content completely editable.</p>
            <p>To handle the head shots of the members of city government, I was presented with a new challenge. They needed to be easy to update from the admin, but also needed to be positioned in the middle of the main content area. I set up a repeater field as usual to handle them, and then created a custom shortcode that would render the repeater field. There is nothing displayed in the admin, but with the repeater field displayed below, managing the content isn't too far away.</p>
