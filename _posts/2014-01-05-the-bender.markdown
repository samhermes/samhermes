DJ Ben Harvey has officially announced that The Bender will be moving to a channel on SiriusXM. I'm happy that it found success, but I'm totally bummed that it will no longer exist as a podcast. It was a super fun year, and I'm so glad I could follow along.

When The Bender started, I think I knew that it would eventually go on to something bigger. Being part of the reason for it's success, it's too bad I can't contiue to listen without having SiriusXM. Like, guys, you don't understand. My world is crumbling.

I discovered Ryan Serhant from Million Dollar Listing from the show. That kind of sounds like I think I'm responsible for his popularity. Maybe I am. All I know is I thoroughly enjoy his Instagrams now because of it. I suppose MDL is pretty cool too.

I was so excited when I found out that Kristen Chenoweth would be a guest, and I think it was my favorite episode. She's so sweet and genuine and legendary. I mean, I don't need to tell you that. I shouldn't have to tell anyone that.

I was a little surprised when Meghan McCain came on the show. You know, John McCain's daughter. She's essentially the opposite from what I was expecting. She's crazy! And has a TV show? I still haven't figured that one out.

I loved hearing Maulik Pancholy on the show, and I think he's one of my favorite people ever. I wish I saw more of him. I guess I'll just have to have a 30 Rock marathon.

So, I'm sad the show is ending in it's podcast form, but I know it will still remain a great place for pop culture and music. Good luck to DJ Ben as he takes the show to the next level.
