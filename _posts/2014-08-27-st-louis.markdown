I moved to St. Louis in May, and have enjoyed getting to know the city. Here are a few photos I've taken while out and about.

View through the arch. Excited about the CityArchRiver project and all the new grass.

Ted Drewes. Probably good that it's not anywhere near my apartment.

Busch Stadium. My parents came to visit and took me to the game. Funnel cake, anyone? Just me? Good.

TEDx event held at Central Library in July. Very interesting + inspiring. Felt inadequate in days following.

In the break between halves of the TEDx event, explored the library. Very cool design touches throughout.

Visited the Contemporary Art Museum. Was most impressed by the building and not so much the art.

The Fabulous Fox. Never disappoints. Mmm, I could go for some roasted pecans. A show would be nice too.
