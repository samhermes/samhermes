When applying a hover effect to a text link, only a quick transition will likely be noticed. Users will rarely hover over a link long enough to see the full transition. I find that adding just 0.1s of transition to a link color can be just enough, and especially to a large button. It removes the harshness of the color change, without looking laborious.
