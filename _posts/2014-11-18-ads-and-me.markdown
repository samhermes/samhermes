Occasionally my mom asks me if I've seen a particular commercial, and usually I haven't. In fact, I don't see many commercials at all.

Since moving into my own apartment, most of my TV watching has been through Netflix. I had a cable subscription for a short bit, and it was pretty awful. The basic package offered by U-verse wasn't in HD, and didn't even have the good channels. I mostly watched the local NBC station. So, I got rid of it and signed up for Netflix. Plus, my brother can also use my account, which is nice.

For music, I use Rdio and iTunes Radio. I pay for both of them, and I find that both have their strengths. Rdio's stations aren't the best, but iTunes Radio is great for that. Rdio lets you sync songs to your phone, which means I can avoid the radio.

Oddly, adding up Netflix, Rdio, and iTunes Radio, I still pay less than I did for the cable subscription on a monthly basis. Silly.

The nice effect of this is that I spend most of my time just focused on content. It's sort of like living in a completely different world. There's this peace. When I used the free version of Spotify, the ads that get injected between songs were always so jarring. And loud.

What I'm trying to say is that it's completely possible to push down the ads, in this crazy, crazy commercial world.

Yes, I'm a millenial.
