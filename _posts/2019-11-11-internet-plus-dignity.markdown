I came across this article recently that speaks about dignity and the internet. I thought that it was an interesting take on the issue, and shows how complex this is.

[The Internet Can Make Us Feel Awful. It Doesn't Have to Be That Way](https://time.com/5505431/internet-feel-awful-dignity/)

One issue that I have with the article is the use of “the internet” to really mean “popular social media.” When we look outside of these gamified environments, the internet is a safe and helpful place. You can read information, make purchases, register for classes. There is a lot of utility outside of popular internet that is aware of your dignity and status as a real life human being.

Similar to fast food, just because a lot of people eat there, it doesn’t mean that it is a good thing.
