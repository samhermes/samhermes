        <a class="post-link" href="/posts/preparing-svg-for-the-web/">Preparing SVG for the web</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I’ve been working with SVG for a while now, and I’ve come to rest on what I’ve found to be the best way to prepare them for the web.</p>
    </li>

        <a class="post-link" href="/posts/adding-syntax-highlighting-to-code/">Adding syntax highlighting to code</a>
      </h3>
      <p>When I started working on the last iteration of my site, I knew I was going to need to figure out how to display code snippets.</p>
    </li>

      <h3>
        <a class="post-link" href="/posts/hover-effects-on-links-should-be-quick/">Hover effects on links should be quick</a>
      </h3>
      <p>When applying a hover effect to a text link, only a quick transition will likely be noticed.</p>
    </li>

      <h3>
        <a class="post-link" href="/posts/what-changes-on-hover-should-be-actionable/">What changes on hover should be actionable</a>
      </h3>
      <p>If an item has a hover state, that hover state should highlight the part of the item that an action can be taken on.</p>

      <h3>
        <a class="post-link" href="/posts/sticky-elements-with-stickyfill/">Sticky elements with Stickyfill</a>
      </h3>
      <p>There are many ways to implement sticky behavior, but as support comes to browsers natively, the best way right now is to use a polyfill.</p>
    </li>

      <h3>
        <a class="post-link" href="/posts/maintaining-state-with-sessionstorage/">Maintaining state with sessionStorage</a>
      </h3>
      <p>When a multi-level menu is collapsed on a small screen, it can difficult to communicate a sense of place as someone is navigating between pages. One way to manage this is to let the browser remember your location with sessionStorage.</p>
    </li>

      <h3>
        <a class="post-link" href="/posts/caching-menu-in-transient-in-wordpress/">Caching a menu in a transient in WordPress</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Menus in WordPress are expensive to generate, in terms of site performance. What if we stored the menu in a transient, and applied the current page classes on the front end using JavaScript?</p>
    </li>

      <span class="post-meta">3/8/2016</span>
      <h3>
        <a class="post-link" href="/posts/toggling-elements-with-javascript/">Toggling elements with JavaScript</a>
      </h3>
      <p>One of the most performant ways to toggle an element with JavaScript is to apply and remove a class.</p>

      <h3>
        <a class="post-link" href="/posts/setting-up-jekyll/">Setting up Jekyll</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I recently switched this site to Jekyll, and I thought I'd share the setup process.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <span class="post-meta">1/30/2016</span>
      <h3>
        <a class="post-link" href="/posts/output-featured-image-caption-wordpress/">Output featured image caption in WordPress</a>
      </h3>
      <p>It's relatively easy and well documented to output a featured image, but getting the caption is a little trickier.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <span class="post-meta">1/4/2016</span>
      <h3>
        <a class="post-link" href="/posts/add-one-hour-to-date-and-time-in-php/">Add 1 hour to date & time in PHP</a>
      </h3>
      <p>This is probably the most magical thing I’ve ever done PHP. Pass in the date and time (in this case, in a variable), tell it what you want to do with it, and out comes the updated date and time.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <span class="post-meta">1/3/2016</span>
      <h3>
        <a class="post-link" href="/posts/using-vertical-height-media-queries-with-fixed-headers/">Using vertical height media queries with fixed headers</a>
      </h3>
      <p>On a site with tall pages, setting up a fixed header can make a lot of sense. Why not use that extra screen real estate? The philosophies of responsive design can and should apply to this as well.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <span class="post-meta">1/2/2016</span>
      <h3>
        <a class="post-link" href="/posts/designing-for-every-moment/">Designing for every moment</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Responsive design is truly about each and every point in between the smallest supported viewport and the largest, which leaves a lot of possibilities.</p>

      <p>Everything I’ve learned about working on the web, I’ve learned on the web.</p>
