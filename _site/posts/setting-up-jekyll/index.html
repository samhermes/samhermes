  <div class="post-content">
    <p>I recently switched this site to Jekyll, and I thought I’d share the setup process. Jekyll was a bit slow the last time I used it, so I was excited to find that the 3.0.0 update included speed improvements that make updates available in the browser almost immediately. Here are some of the configuration changes I made outside of the defaults:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Changed the permalink structure to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/posts/:title/</code>. I made this update in config.yml, refreshed the site, and nothing changed. A little digging, and I found out that changes to config.yml will not be processed while <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code> is running. You’ll need to ctrl-c and <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code> again.</li>
  <li>I was using m/d/Y to display dates, and so in looking at how to set that up in Jekyll, I found an <a href="http://alanwsmith.com/jekyll-liquid-date-formatting-examples">article from Allan W. Smith</a> that detailed all of the possibilities. It can be accomplished with <code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span><span class="err">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">post.date</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">date:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">"%-m/%-d/%Y"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">}}</span></code>.</li>
  <li>I display excerpts from posts on the homepage, and in order to specify those manually, you can add an <code class="highlighter-rouge">excerpt:</code> declaration to the YAML front matter on each post and specify the excerpt there. It can then be output with <code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span><span class="err">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">post.excerpt</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="err">}</span></code>. Jekyll will automatically give you an excerpt, but for posts that start with a code snippet, that was not ideal.</li>
  <li>For posts that include code snippets, I use <a href="http://prismjs.com/">prism.js</a> for formatting. To include the file only on posts that use it, I add <code class="highlighter-rouge">custom_js: prism</code>  to the front matter. In footer.html, I’ve added the following, which takes care of outputting the script tag:
    <pre><code class="language-markup">{% if page.custom_js %}
  {% for js_file in page.custom_js %}</code>
    <code class="language-javascript">&lt;script src='/js/{{ js_file }}.js' type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
  <code class="language-markup">{% endfor %}
{% endif %}</code></pre>
    <p>This also allows for the possibility of additional js files, so I can just add the name of a file I’d like to include to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">custom_js</code> declaration. Learned this trick on <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/page-specific-assets-with-jekyll/">Matt Gemmell’s site</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>I wanted my 404 page to live at /404.html. By default, Jekyll takes that and moves it to /404/index.html. To change that, I added <code class="highlighter-rouge">permalink: /404.html</code> to the YAML front matter on the page.</li>
</ul>

<p>Phew. That was more that I thought. Hope this helps speed things up for you.</p>
