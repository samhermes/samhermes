    <p>Everything I’ve learned about working on the web, I’ve learned on the web. From reading blogs to doing Treehouse courses to simply reading Twitter, it all took place on one website or another. Up to this point, I’ve really only been taking things in. I don’t think it’s a bad thing, I’ve simply been learning as much as I can. However, I think the time has come that I try to give back a little.</p>

<p>I am switching my website from portfolio to blog, and starting to share what I know. In my experience, when searching for an answer to a specific question, I know that a short, concise post can be all it takes to put the last piece into a puzzle. I’ll be taking that approach, posting snippets of code and quick explanations of how I solved a problem.</p>

<p>If this is the first post you’ve read here, then there is already more! Head back to posts to read them.</p>
