	      <p>Web development depends so heavily on the past and the future, both respecting the standards and best practices that came before, and looking to the future and working in a way that will allow for flexibility down the line.</p>

	      </h2>
	      <p>High density screens and the web are at odds. On one side, we want sites to look as crisp as possible, no matter where they are being viewed, but on the other hand, performance is incredibly important.</p>

	      <p>As I’ve been out browsing the web lately, I’ve come across quite a few sticky headers that are implemented in a way that causes the page to jump up as scrolling begins.</p>

	      <p>There are many ways to implement sticky behavior, but as support comes to browsers natively, the best way right now is to use a polyfill.</p>

	      </h2>
	      <p>When a multi-level menu is collapsed on a small screen, it can difficult to communicate a sense of place as someone is navigating between pages. One way to manage this is to let the browser remember your location with sessionStorage.</p>

	      </h2>
	      <p>Menus in WordPress are expensive to generate, in terms of site performance. What if we stored the menu in a transient, and applied the current page classes on the front end using JavaScript?</p>

	      </h2>
	      <p>This is probably the most magical thing I’ve ever done PHP. Pass in the date and time (in this case, in a variable), tell it what you want to do with it, and out comes the updated date and time.</p>

	      </h2>
	      <p>On a site with tall pages, setting up a fixed header can make a lot of sense. Why not use that extra screen real estate? The philosophies of responsive design can and should apply to this as well.</p>
