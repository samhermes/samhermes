title:  I am not an introvert

I think I am as guilty as anyone when it comes to assigning labels to myself and then limiting myself based on them. I tell myself that I would or wouldn't do something because of the profile I've created of myself. I think telling myself that I'm an introvert has hurt me.

I've taken the Myers Briggs countless times. I've almost always been ISTJ, placing me over in what seemed to be a lonely little corner. While I can relate to what the test says about me, I know that I am infinitely complex. We all are. I also know that the Myers Briggs is practically useless, and despite that fact, we still seem to be using it to inform ourselves.

I am not an introvert. I need people as much as they need me. I get energy from all kinds of places. Sometimes I do need a little time to recoup, but who doesn't? Here's to dumping labels and setting myself free.
